VBA automation for monthly client ledger generation and compliance reporting (law firm client)

---

This repository contains Excel VBA macros developed to automate monthly client trust account ledger preparation in a law firm environment subject to California compliance requirements.

Manual preparation of client ledgers is time-consuming and carries significant audit and licensing risk if errors occur. These tools replace a repetitive, error-prone workflow with a one-click automated process.

## Project Overview

- Produces a firm-wide overview of client balances

### 2. Individual Client Ledgers
- Automatically generates one Excel file per client per month
- Itemizes all transactions and reconciles totals to client balances
- Designed to meet monthly ledger requirements for compliance and audit readiness
